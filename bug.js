This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions.  The issue is that the `Dimensions` API returns an object with `width` and `height` properties, but these properties are not always immediately available, especially when the app is first launched or when the device orientation changes. Trying to access `Dimensions.get('window').width` or `Dimensions.get('screen').height` synchronously may result in undefined values.

```javascript
// Incorrect usage
const {width, height} = Dimensions.get('window');
console.log(width, height); // May log undefined, undefined
```
